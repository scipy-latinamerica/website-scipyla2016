<h1>SciPyLA 2016 Financial Aid</h1>

<p>
{% trans "SciPyLA 2016 will continue the tradition of offering sponsorships to attend the conference. These sponsorships can provide funding for airfare and lodging. Like last year, these sponsorships will be open to community members and students." %}
</p>

<p>
{% trans "Applications will be judged both on merit as well as need. Although all attendees are eligible for sponsorships, we encourage applicants to consider their level of need before applying, such as whether their institution is covering some or all of their travel costs. As funds are limited, our goal is to bring together as many SciPy community members as possible. If only partial sponsorship is required, please indicate this in the application and we may be able to accommodate additional applicants due to such reasonable requests." %}

<p>
{% trans "To apply to the financial aid select the ticket <em>Palestras (com pedido de aux√≠lio financeiro)</em> on the box bellow and complete the ticket request.  We will avaliate your request as soon as possible and get back to you." %}
